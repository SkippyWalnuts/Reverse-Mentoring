        <p>
            In the 2022 Reverse Mentoring scheme with Global Media, employees with under-represented identities at
            leadership-level became
            <span class="participants">Mentors</span> to a large number of volunteers within the Executive Leadership
            team.
            <span class="participants">Mentors</span> shared life experiences and perspectives on a monthly basis to
            help
            leaders develop a more inclusive mindset at dentsu, building partnerships between people who may never
            normally
            interact outside of
            such a programme.
            <br>

            <br>
            Workshops led by <span class="participants">Mentor Advisors</span> gave guidance and a chance to reflect
            with
            peers on inclusion-related
            topics:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li class="workshops">Privilege</li>
            <li class="workshops">Empathy</li>
            <li class="workshops">Setting boundaries</li>
            <li class="workshops">Accountability</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            To close the year, <span class="participants">Mentors</span> were asked to help <span
                class="participants">Mentees</span> set a 2023 performance objective to
            further educate themselves as a direct result of their mentoring relationship.
            <br>
            <br>
            The success and impact of the programme was measured by the feedback and regular participation of those
            involved; <span class="participants">14 partnerships were considered a success by December 2022</span>
            as a result of star-ratings submitted by participants:
